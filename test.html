          Imagine walking into a restaurant and being told, "You can't come in," or being stranded at an airport because none of the taxis will take you home, or making a room reservation, only to have it cancelled by the hotel because you're not welcome. 
          Discrimination against people with assistance dogs happens more often than you might imagine, and it never gets easier.

            A survey of more than 1,000 assistance dog owners, conducted by Guide Dogs in spring 2015, found that 75% had been refused access to a restaurant, shop or taxi because they had an assistance dog with them.
          The main offenders are restaurants, cafes, movie theatres,
          as well as taxis and ride share services like Uber.

            states that taxi and minicab drivers must carry assistance dogs unless they have genuine health reasons not to do so.
            Local authorities will provide a driver with an exemption certificate if they give proof from an appropriately qualified medic. 
            The certificates should then be available to show to an assistance dog owner on demand.

            Many people don't realize that it's not only rude, but it's illegal to deny access or refuse service to a person who's working with a guide dog. So, if it's against the law, why does it keep happening? Like so many other forms of discrimination, it's deeply rooted in ignorance. In many cases, businesses don't realize they're breaking the law by denying access or refusing service to a guide dog team.

            We live in a fast-moving, ever-progressing world. At a time when communities are focusing on accessibility and inclusion – and smashing the barriers that stand in the way of Canadians with disabilities – now is the time for businesses to step up and do their part. 

  You can do your part too. If you see discrimination against a guide dog team, speak up and offer your support to the person who is blind or partially sighted.  They may not know what's happening around them – and providing visual information such as the taxi number or other visual cues will go a long way towards helping guide dog handlers to self-advocate. Guide dogs belong everywhere. It's the law.
